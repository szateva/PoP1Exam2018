""" Consider the following scenario.
Yasmine and Poppy are working a software system and are using git, a distributed
version control system to manage their code. Poppy pulls from the master repository
and updates her working copy. She realises there is a bug in the code and works to x
it. When she is nished, she commits her code. The next day, Yasmine begins working
on the code by pulling from the master repository and updating her working copy. She
too realises the code has a bug (the same one Poppy saw) and spends the whole day
xing it.
What went wrong? Why didn't Yasmine benet from Poppy's work? """
